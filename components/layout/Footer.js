              Investment opportunities posted on this Site are private
              placements of securities that are not publicly traded, involve a
              high degree of risk, may lose value, are subject to holding period
              requirements and are intended for investors who do not need a
              liquid investment. Past performance is not indicative of future
              results. Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire
              investment. Qualified investors, which may be restricted to only
              Accredited Investors or non-U.S. persons, should invest in
              offerings hosted by fundSME.

              Neither fundSME nor any of their officers, directors, agents and
              employees makes any warranty, express or implied, of any kind
              whatsoever related to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of
              any information on this Site or the use of information on this
              site. Offers to sell securities can only be made through official
              offering documents that contain important information about the
              investment and the issuers, including risks. Investors should
              carefully read the offering documents. Investors should conduct
              their own due diligence and are encouraged to consult with their
              tax, legal and financial advisors.

              <br />
              Investors should verify any issuer information they consider
              important before making an investment. Investments in private
              companies are particularly risky and may result in total loss of
              invested capital. Past performance of a security or a company does
              not guarantee future results or returns. Only investors who
              understand the risks of early stage investment and who meet the
              fundSME's investment criteria may invest.
              <br />

              any such information. Additional information about companies
