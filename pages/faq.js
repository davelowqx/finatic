                Investment opportunities posted on this Site are private
                placements of securities that are not publicly traded, involve a
                high degree of risk, may lose value, are subject to holding
                period requirements and are intended for investors who do not
                need a liquid investment. Past performance is not indicative of
                future results. Investors must be able to afford the loss of
                their entire investment. Qualified investors, which may be
                restricted to only Accredited Investors or non-U.S. persons,
                should invest in offerings hosted by fundSME.

                Neither fundSME nor any of their officers, directors, agents and
                employees makes any warranty, express or implied, of any kind
                whatsoever related to the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of
                any information on this Site or the use of information on this
                site. Offers to sell securities can only be made through
                official offering documents that contain important information
                about the investment and the issuers, including risks. Investors
                should carefully read the offering documents. Investors should
                conduct their own due diligence and are encouraged to consult
                with their tax, legal and financial advisors.

                Investors should verify any issuer information they consider
                important before making an investment. Investments in private
                companies are particularly risky and may result in total loss of
                invested capital. Past performance of a security or a company
                does not guarantee future results or returns. Only investors who
                understand the risks of early stage investment and who meet the
                fundSME's investment criteria may invest.
