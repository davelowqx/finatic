                  Previously, angel investing was only available to the
                  wealthiest people, with regulators commonly citing the high
                  risks of investing in early stage companies. This is
                  controversial, as life changing wealth can be created by
                  investing early. This spurred us to create fundSME, where
                  anyone with an ethereum wallet can back projects they believe
                  in.

              <div>
                When a founder lists his company on fundSME, a smart contract is
                created on the <span>Ethereum Network</span>, storing immutable
                details about the company such as the company's name and symbol,
                the manager's Ethereum address and the current shares
                outstanding. The creation of the smart contract will incur some
                gas fees, preventing misuse of the platform. Thereafter, the
                manager will be able to create funding rounds with a target
                amount and additional shares to be offered. Investors are able
                to invest in these funding rounds, where the minimum investment
                will be equal to the price of one share. After 60 days, the
                manager shall conclude the funding round. If the funding goals
                are met, tokenized shares of the company will be issued to the
                investors. These shares are ERC-20 tokens which can be easily
                added to a MetaMask wallet. However, if the funding round failed
                to meet its target, all investors will be fully refunded.

                  Most other equity financing platforms depend on a central
                  authority for trust. As history has shown time and again,
                  having a single point of failure can prove fatal, especially
                  when dealing with large pools of capital. On the other hand,
                  fundSME is one of the many Decentralised Finance projects
                  leveraging on the well-established Ethereum Network. The rules
                  governing every action on this platform are etched in{" "}
                  <a href="https:github.com/davelowqx/fundsme">code</a> and
                  stored immutably on the Ethereum Network as smart contracts.

                <p>
                  Every investor should be aware that investing in companies on
                  fundSME's platform involves a high degree of risk, regardless
                  of any assurance provided by the company.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There can be no assurance that: any information or projection
                  by the company has been validated or is reliable, a startup
                  will achieve its business plan, or an investor will receive a
                  return of any part of its investment or any investment
                  purchased through the Republic platform will be able to be
                  resold.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The following considerations, among others, should be
                  carefully evaluated before making an investment in a company
                  through its offering on Republic.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Risk inherent in startup investments; investors may, and
                  frequently do, lose all of their investment Investments in
                  startups (including early-stage ventures and emerging
                  technology companies) involve a high degree of risk.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Financial and operating risks confronting startups are
                  significant. While targeted returns should reflect the
                  perceived level of risk in any investment situation, such
                  returns may never be realized and/or may not be adequate to
                  compensate an investor for risks taken.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Loss of an investorâ€™s entire investment is possible and can
                  easily occur. Moreover, the timing of any return on investment
                  is highly uncertain. The startup market is highly competitive
                  and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is
                  small.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Startups often experience unexpected problems in the areas of
                  product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and
                  general management, among others, which frequently cannot be
                  solved. Startups may require substantial amounts of financing,
                  which may not be available through institutional private
                  placements, the public markets or otherwise.
